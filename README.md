crant
=====
The crant toolkit is designed to streamline the package development process.


Workflow
========

Build R, set up package libraries, build your own packages.

Build R
-------
Make sure crant is in your path and then build your instances of R. If you
already have an R instance and don't want to build from source, you can skip
this step (although you still need to have crant in your path).

    export PATH=$PATH:path/to/crant
    buildenv.sh -u

If the OS is brand new, then include the -d option to install dependencies.
These include packages like make, gcc, gfortran, java, etc.

    buildenv.sh -du

The end result is that you will have 3 installations of R built from source
that correspond to the latest minor release (e.g. 2.15), the latest patch
release (e.g. 2.15.2), and the current development source (R-devel).

As the source changes over time, you can re-build the R versions to stay
current. The defaults will change by the maintainer to be current with the
latest point and patch releases.

Installing libraries
--------------------
Libraries need to be built once R has been built successfully. These are
typically the package dependencies you have. At a minimum you will probably
want the unit testing packages since these are usually listed as 'suggested',
so will not be downloaded automatically.

    setuplib.sh -R path/to/R RUnit testthat

Note that if your R instance is in your path, you do not need to manually
set the path to the R executable.

Building your package
---------------------
The crant script will build and check your package. If your source is within a
source repository, crant will attempt to export the latest committed version
to a separate directory (export). The only required variable is the package
name, although typically you will also want to provide the version number.

    crant -v 1.0.0 your.package

To ignore the repository version and pull the latest working copy use the `-S`
option.

If testing your package just before uploading to CRAN, it is wise to test 
against the three versions of R you built before. Use the same `-R` option as
before.

    crant -v 1.0.0 -R path/to/R your.package

Note that crant will automatically update the version and date in the
`DESCRIPTION`, `man/*-package.Rd` and `R/*-package.R` files for you.
In addition, for the files `NEWS`, `NEWS.md` and `ChangeLog`, if a corresponding
file with the extension `.tmpl` exists, its contents are prepended to the file
(placeholders `$VERSION` and `$BUILDDATE` are substituted).

### Other Options

+ `-s` - Do not autocommit, allow dirty working copy
+ `-S` - Build against uncommitted source. Implies `-s`
+ `-i` - Install the package after building
+ `-I` - Copy (overwrite) the package `.tar.gz` to the parent directory after building
+ `-r` - Run the CRAN checks
+ `-C` - Do not run `R CMD check`
+ `-V` - Do not build vignettes, even not when running CRAN checks
+ `-M` - Do not build manual, even not when running CRAN checks
+ `-u #` - Increment version number at specific position, # = 1..4 (instead of `-v`)
+ `-d DATE` - Specify build date
+ `-x` - Roxygenize
+ `-X` - Roxygenize and exit
+ `-R /path/to/R` - Use specific R interpreter
+ `-b` - Build binary package
+ `-h HOSTNAME` - Build binary package on Windows host `HOSTNAME`
    + SSH service and bash is assumed to be installed on remote Windows host
    + Package is assumed to be located in directory `$WORKSPACE` on remote host
+ `-e` - Export to CRAN (not yet implemented)
    + `-D` - Use `--resave-data` when executing `R CMD build`

Mac OS X Notes
==============
Since Mac OS X comes from a BSD lineage, the versions of base utility
commands have different syntax. This causes a lot of problems. The
workaround is to install ```coreutils```, which installs the GNU 
variants of all the commands. The crant script detects a Darwin platform
and will substitute the ```g``` variants for the standard commands.
